# **App Name**: StroopTest Challenge

## Core Features:

- Combination Generation: Generate a random color and word combination, ensuring the color and word do not match (e.g., the word 'blue' displayed in red).
- Combination Display: Display the generated color-word combination prominently on the screen.
- Color Selection Buttons: Provide a set of color choices (buttons) for the user to select the color in which the word is displayed.
- Response Time Measurement: Measure and record the user's response time for each trial.
- Score Tracking and Display: Track and display the user's score (number of correct answers) and average response time.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant purple (#A050BE) evoking creativity and focus. This will be used sparingly to make important elements stand out without distracting from the central task.
- Background color: A very light desaturated lavender (#F4F0F7) to minimize distraction and eye strain. Using a nearly-white background keeps focus on the test.
- Accent color: A deep indigo (#50409A) that's close to the purple to help highlight choices and call to action. Contrast is stronger with the light background than it would be against a darker background.
- Use clear, readable font for word and color options, optimized for quick recognition.
- Simple icons for settings or instructions; avoid distracting or colorful imagery.
- Clean and minimal design with central focus on the color-word combination.
- Subtle transitions for correct/incorrect feedback to avoid distraction.
